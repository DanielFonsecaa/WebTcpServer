# WebTcpServer
Creation of a Web Tcp Server

Making a simple web server with tcp, that can send to the local host browser the content provide by my professors. Can have 3 types. 
If the resourse is /index.html will print one thing
If the resourse is /logo.png will print the logo of code for all
and if you dont put anything or something wrong will give a 404 error.

Also on the class I missunderstand the assingment so I did a Http server and leave it there.
