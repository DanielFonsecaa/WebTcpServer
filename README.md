# WebTcpServer
Creation of a Web Tcp Server

Making a simple web server with tcp, that can send to the local host browser the content provide by my professors. Can have 3 types. 

type - localhost:8081/index.html to print the text html
type - localhost:8081/logo.png to print the logo png
if you type other thing or misspelling will give 404 error

Also on the class I missunderstand the assingment so I did a Http server and leave it there.
